# Introduction

Media continues to play an active role in the development and evolution of society to date. Because of our severe advancements in technology, streaming popular movies is easier than ever. Media is now more accessible than ever. Now that more and more people are having access to content on the internet, it is important to take notice of which movies are being preferred, rated, and consistently viewed. With this insight, we can observe the gender-biased ways in which consume media. Are movies with all-male casts more likely to be streamed and more and rated higher than movies with an all-female cast? In what years was this witnessed? In what genres is this observation applicable? The dataset “IMDb data from 2006 to 2016” will aid in the pursuit of finding gender biases in the viewers of the most popular movies on the IMDb website. This dataset includes 1,000 of the most popular movies in the last 10 years. In this dataset, we will continue to monitor genre, revenue, actors, and metascore, in order to accurately assess whether the most popular and highly ranked movies are made by the same director, as well as the same actors. We are hoping to answer questions regarding the most frequently seen actors, directors, and genres, as well as their correlation to ranking and runtime in the dataset. 


# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways
## Summary of Data Analysis
After our analysis, we are able to answer our three main questions. Our first graph shows the average IMDB movie ratings per year, answering our first question. The year with the highest average movie rating is 2007 while 2016 is the year with the lowest. There seems to be a negative relationship between the year and average movie ratings. We thought this was an interesting finding because some would expect the opposite. You would think that more recent movies have more technology to work with. Our second graph shows that there is a positive relationship between the movie runtime in minutes and the movie ratings. This answers our second question. The trend displays that the longer a movie is, the higher the ratings are generally. This was also surprising to us considering that longer movies could really be dragging. However, it could be that more effort is put into a movie that has a longer runtime in minutes. Lastly, our third graph shows that Action movies are the most frequent and the most popular movie genre, while romance is the least popular. This answers our third question. The action movie genre is on the data set with a frequency of 293, following Drama with 193, and comedy with 175. It makes sense that action is a very frequent movie genre as it seems like it is also the most talked about usually. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the highest-rated movie is The Dark Night while the lowest-rated movie is The Disaster Movie. Interestingly, both of those movies were released in the year 2008. 

## Analysis Discussion
Interpreting the results and contextualizing the conclusions of a data analysis requires a familiarity with the dataset. In this case that means understanding the part that the IMDB website plays in the wider cinematic landscape. The IMDB ratings are user generated and are subject to the usual forces that influence all kinds of internet reviews. Since users must search up a specific movie on the internet they are much more likely to leave a review on a movie they have strong feelings (positive or negative) for, compared to a movie they thought was "just okay". This trend toward very positive and very negative reviews can be seen almost everywhere on the internet, and it is certainly something will affect any analysis of IMDB movie ratings. Another factor in a movie's placement is the number of reviews and the amount of traffic an IMDB movie page receives. Movies with broad appeal and a less restrictive age rating will be seen and reviewed by a larger audience, which could in turn impact the genre frequencies we look at with our analysis.

## Broader Implications
Cinema is a form of art that often reflects the values of the society which produces it. Often movies are used by their creators to shine a light on a particular aspect of our society, or on a specific character and their place in the world. Because movies are a from of art—with the usual subjectivity accompanying creative pursuits—it is difficult to rate them with a purely numeric scale. Though our group looked at many facets of the data in the set, like genre, actors and directors, year of release, in addition to ratings, it is still very difficult to draw conclusions about gender bias. For example, if a particular male director appears in the dataset numerous times, is that due to gender biases in the way we produce and consume cinema, or is that simply an artist being rewarded with more opportunity as a result of their previous success?
