# Introduction

Media continues to play an active role in the development and evolution of society to date. Because of our severe advancements in technology, streaming popular movies is easier than ever. Media is now more accessible than ever. Now that more and more people are having access to content on the internet, it is important to take notice of which movies are being preferred, rated, and consistently viewed. With this insight, we can observe the gender-biased ways in which consume media. Are movies with all-male casts more likely to be streamed and more and rated higher than movies with an all-female cast? In what years was this witnessed? In what genres is this observation applicable? The dataset “IMDb data from 2006 to 2016” will aid in the pursuit of finding gender biases in the viewers of the most popular movies on the IMDb website. This dataset includes 1,000 of the most popular movies in the last 10 years. In this dataset, we will continue to monitor genre, revenue, actors, and metascore, in order to accurately assess whether the most popular and highly ranked movies are made by the same director, as well as the same actors. We are hoping to answer questions regarding the most frequently seen actors, directors, and genres, as well as their correlation to ranking and runtime in the dataset.
